# python-financial-analysis
An initial dive into leveraging python and its machine learning capabilities to analyze financial data (mainly in the form of stock prices). The modules are ordered and generally increase in complexity. For machine learning, sci-kit learn was used with the following classifiers: LinearSVC, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.

### Sample Outputs
Tesla stock price history, mapped via matplotlib. The top graph plots adjusted closes (red) and 100-day Moving Averages. The bottom graph indicates volume.
